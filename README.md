# 🌌 Project Voidmarch

**Project Voidmarch** is an action-RTS hybrid built in **C++** using the **Raylib** engine — a fast, open-source framework for 2D game development.  
Set in a surreal, space-fueled fantasy world, Voidmarch fuses **real-time combat**, **scaling-based progression**, and **tactical positioning** into a single cohesive gameplay experience.

## 🎮 Game Overview

**Genre:** 2D Action / Strategy Hybrid  
**Engine:** Raylib (C++)  
**Languages:** C++17 / Rust (for math and performance-critical modules)  
**Platforms:** Windows (MSYS2 + MinGW64), Linux (Fedora)  

In Voidmarch, players command unique races with distinct playstyles, weapons, and abilities — navigating intricate arenas, striking with precision, and evolving their strength through a dynamic scaling system.

### ✦ Playable Races
- **Voidcrawler** – fast, shadow-based attacks and teleport mobility  
- **Spacelizard** – hybrid of melee and plasma weaponry  
- **Mecha-Sapien** – heavy gunner with modular upgrades  
- **Human** – balanced stats and access to diverse weapon classes  

### ✦ Combat & Progression
- Real-time combat based on weapon type and profession  
- Melee and ranged weapon systems (swords, blasters, projectiles)  
- Damage scaling and level-wide pixel-scale consistency via `ScaleSystem`  
- Procedural enemy behaviors and sector collision detection (`sector_hit.hpp`)

## 🧠 Technical Overview

Voidmarch emphasizes **modularity** and **clean separation of logic**, ensuring maintainability and easy expansion.

### 🔩 Core Systems
| System | Description |
|--------|--------------|
| **ScaleSystem** | Handles resolution-independent pixel scaling across devices. |
| **PlayerTexManager** | Singleton managing race and profession texture sets. |
| **Weapon Abstraction** | Unified melee/ranged interface for attack logic. |
| **UI Manager** | Modular UI system with dynamic buttons and state transitions. |
| **Math Core (Rust)** | Optimized math module written in Rust and linked via FFI. |
